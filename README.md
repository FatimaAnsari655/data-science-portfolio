## 📂 Project Details

### 1. Coders of Delhi (CodeBook Analysis) 💻
**📌 Overview:** This project simulates a real-world scenario acting as a Data Scientist Intern for a social media startup. The challenge was to analyze a user data dump using **Pure Python** only—strictly no Pandas or NumPy.

**🎯 Objective:**
* Load and parse complex nested JSON data.
* Extract user information, friend connections, and interests.
* Map user IDs to friend names using algorithm logic.

**📈 Key Learnings:**
* Deep understanding of Python Dictionaries and Lists.
* Efficient file handling and JSON parsing.

### 2. Coders of Bangalore (Advanced Analysis) 🏙️
**📌 Overview:** Building upon the Delhi project, this analysis focuses on the Bangalore tech community. It involves handling larger datasets and implementing more complex relationship mapping.

**🎯 Objective:**
* Identify common interest clusters among developers.
* Implement "People You May Know" logic using mutual friend connections.
* Categorize trending technologies based on user liked pages.

**📈 Key Learnings:**
* Scalability: Handling larger JSON files with nested structures.
* Recommendation Logic: Using Set Theory and logic for user networking.
